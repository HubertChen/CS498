CS498 - Python Assignment

1. Find out how to use system calls and command substitution in Python 

	To write System calls use the call() function from the subprocess
	module. To do a command substitution use teh check_output() function from the
	subprocess. 

2. OK

3. OK

4. What is the functional programming paradigm? Show and explain an example of functional 
   programming in Python. List the information sources you used in your answer. 
	
	The functional programming paradigm is the idea to solve problems using functions.
   The opposite of the functional paradigm is the imperative paradigm. Imperative programming
   involves changing the state of objects and using loops, conditionals and function calls.
   Functional programming involves using recursion of functions and does not track changes to
   object states.

   Given L = [1,2,3,4,5]
   
   Imperative:

	sum = 0 
	for x in L:
		sum += x

   Functional:

	def add(x,y):
		return x+y
	sum = reduce(add, L)
