	a.
 
	 - When there are more elements on the right, the elements get ignored and are not assigned to the variables $a or $b

	The 'use strict' pragma can help automatically identify bugs in your code. One of the requirements is that you have to declare before using it.

	- "Perl was designed with TIMTOWTDI in mind as Larry Wall designed it to try and give as much freedom to the user as possible with the 
	hope of allowing expressiveness and beautifully designed code. "

	- TIMTOWTDI can be a strength because if you are really good with perl, then you can get things done more efficiently. And it could
	also be more fun

	- One weakness is due to its conformity, it is harder to read. Although one can develop a clever and efficient way to get something done in Perl,
	 it can also lead future programmers to have a hard time understanding the intention of the original programmer.
